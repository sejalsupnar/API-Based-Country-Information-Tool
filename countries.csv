The term is so ingrained, that it is still used in international news reports, especially when the news is of a nature contradicting the image, such as the Copenhagen riots or the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.\nDenmark has a relatively large outbound tourism, with Spain as primary destination, accounting for 14% of all overnight stays abroad of four days or more in 2013.

In many provinces of Anatolia, monumental buildings such as ancient churches, mosques and caravanserais were restored and converted into museums. Topkapı Palace, which was converted into a museum with the furniture and works of art on the premises, was opened to the public in 1927. The same year, the Islamic Museum was reorganized as the ""Museum  of  Turkish  and Islamic Works of Art"" and the Mevlana Dervish Lodge in Konya was also converted into a museum.\nThe construction of the Ankara Ethnographical Museum, the first building designed as a museum, was completed in 1930. New museums were established in Bursa, Adana, Manisa, İzmir, Kayseri, Antalya, Afyon, Bergama, and Edirne. The Hittite Museum, which was established in the Mahmut Pasha Bedesten in Ankara in 1940, was restored and renovated and converted into ""Museum of Anatolian Civilizations"" in 1968.\nToday, there are 99 museum directorates attached to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, 151 private museums in 36 provinces and 1,204 private collections.\n\n', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Istanbularcheology.jpg/500px-Istanbularcheology.jpg'}]"

In 2010, Lonely Planet termed Pakistan ""tourism\'s \'next big thing\'"". The country is geographically and ethnically diverse, and has a number of historical and cultural heritage sites. Condé Nast Traveller ranked Pakistan The Best Holiday Destination for 2020 and also declared it the third-highest potential adventure destination in the world for 2020. As security in the country improves, tourism increases; in two years, it has increased by more than 300%.\nIn 2018, the British Backpacker Society ranked Pakistan the world\'s top adventure travel destination, describing the country as ""one of the friendliest countries on earth, with mountain scenery that is beyond anyone\'s wildest imagination"". Forbes ranked Pakistan as one of the ‘coolest places’ to visit in 2019. The World Economic Forum\'s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report placed Pakistan in the top 25 percent of global destinations for its World Heritage Sites, which range from the mangroves in the Indus delta to the Indus Valley civilization sites including Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum\'s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017, the direct contribution of travel and tourism to Pakistan\'s GDP in 2015 was US$328.3 million, constituting 2.8% of the total GDP. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the direct contribution of travel and tourism to Pakistan\'s GDP in 2016 was Rs. 793 billion (equivalent to Rs. 4.0 trillion or US$14 billion in 2021), constituting 2.7% of the total GDP. By 2025, the government predicts tourism will contribute Rs. 1 trillion (US$3.5 billion) to the Pakistani economy.\nIn October 2006, one year after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, The Guardian released a list of ""the top five tourist sites in Pakistan"" to help the country\'s tourism industry. The sites included Lahore, the Karakoram Highway, Karimabad and Lake Saiful Muluk. To promote the country\'s cultural heritage, in 2007, Pakistan launched the ""Visit Pakistan"" marketing campaign that involved events including fairs, religious festivals, regional sporting events, arts and craft shows, folk festivals and openings of historical museums.\nIn 2013, over half a million tourists visited Pakistan, contributing $298 million; these figures have since risen to over 6.6 million tourists in 2018. By comparison, Pakistan\'s domestic tourism industry is estimated at 50 million tourists who travel in the country on short trips usually between May and August. The largest inflow of tourists are from the United Kingdom, followed by the United States, India and China.\n\n', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Lahore_Fort.jpg/500px-Lahore_Fort.jpg'}, {'name': 'List of tourist attractions in Karachi', 'detail': 'Karachi is a tourist destination for domestic and international tourists.

In 2010, Lonely Planet termed Pakistan ""tourism\'s \'next big thing\'"". The country is geographically and ethnically diverse, and has a number of historical and cultural heritage sites. Condé Nast Traveller ranked Pakistan The Best Holiday Destination for 2020 and also declared it the third-highest potential adventure destination in the world for 2020. As security in the country improves, tourism increases; in two years, it has increased by more than 300%.\nIn 2018, the British Backpacker Society ranked Pakistan the world\'s top adventure travel destination, describing the country as ""one of the friendliest countries on earth, with mountain scenery that is beyond anyone\'s wildest imagination"". Forbes ranked Pakistan as one of the ‘coolest places’ to visit in 2019. The World Economic Forum\'s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report placed Pakistan in the top 25 percent of global destinations for its World Heritage Sites, which range from the mangroves in the Indus delta to the Indus Valley civilization sites including Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum\'s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017, the direct contribution of travel and tourism to Pakistan\'s GDP in 2015 was US$328.3 million, constituting 2.8% of the total GDP. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the direct contribution of travel and tourism to Pakistan\'s GDP in 2016 was Rs. 793 billion (equivalent to Rs. 4.0 trillion or US$14 billion in 2021), constituting 2.7% of the total GDP. By 2025, the government predicts tourism will contribute Rs. 1 trillion (US$3.5 billion) to the Pakistani economy.\nIn October 2006, one year after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, The Guardian released a list of ""the top five tourist sites in Pakistan"" to help the country\'s tourism industry. The sites included Lahore, the Karakoram Highway, Karimabad and Lake Saiful Muluk. To promote the country\'s cultural heritage, in 2007, Pakistan launched the ""Visit Pakistan"" marketing campaign that involved events including fairs, religious festivals, regional sporting events, arts and craft shows, folk festivals and openings of historical museums.\nIn 2013, over half a million tourists visited Pakistan, contributing $298 million; these figures have since risen to over 6.6 million tourists in 2018. By comparison, Pakistan\'s domestic tourism industry is estimated at 50 million tourists who travel in the country on short trips usually between May and August. The largest inflow of tourists are from the United Kingdom, followed by the United States, India and China.\n\n', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Lahore_Fort.jpg/500px-Lahore_Fort.jpg'}, {'name': 'Lists of tourist attractions', 'detail': 'The following lists of tourist attractions include tourist attractions in various countries.', 'image': 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Victoria_Falls_aerial_view_September_2003.jpg/500px-Victoria_Falls_aerial_view_September_2003.jpg'}]"

As security in the country improves, tourism increases; in two years, it has increased by more than 300%.\nIn 2018, the British Backpacker Society ranked Pakistan the world\'s top adventure travel destination, describing the country as ""one of the friendliest countries on earth, with mountain scenery that is beyond anyone\'s wildest imagination"". Forbes ranked Pakistan as one of the ‘coolest places’ to visit in 2019.

By 2025, the government predicts tourism will contribute Rs. 1 trillion (US$3.5 billion) to the Pakistani economy.\nIn October 2006, one year after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, The Guardian released a list of ""the top five tourist sites in Pakistan"" to help the country\'s tourism industry. The sites included Lahore, the Karakoram Highway, Karimabad and Lake Saiful Muluk. To promote the country\'s cultural heritage, in 2007, Pakistan launched the ""Visit Pakistan"" marketing campaign that involved events including fairs, religious festivals, regional sporting events, arts and craft shows, folk festivals and openings of historical museums.\nIn 2013, over half a million tourists visited Pakistan, contributing $298 million; these figures have since risen to over 6.6 million tourists in 2018. By comparison, Pakistan\'s domestic tourism industry is estimated at 50 million tourists who travel in the country on short trips usually between May and August.
